# 👋 Hi, I’m Vigneshwaran (@vicky-data)

👀 I’m interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, BFSI Analytics, and solving real-world business problems with data.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced machine learning, time series forecasting, and Generative AI to enhance my portfolio.

💼 I’ve built projects in customer segmentation, loan default prediction, and time series forecasting — focused on delivering business insights.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on real-world analytics and ML projects, especially in finance, retail, or supply chain domains.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: I started my journey in civil engineering but pivoted to data science to build models that impact millions. I love storytelling with data just as much as building models.
