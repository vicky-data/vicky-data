👋 Hi, I’m Vigneshwaran (@vicky-data)

👀 I’m interested in Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, BFSI Analytics, and solving real-world business problems with data.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced analytics, time series forecasting, and Generative AI to enhance my portfolio.

💼 I’ve built projects in vendor analysis, churn analytics, financial data analysis, and credit risk modeling — focused on delivering actionable business insights.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on real-world analytics and ML projects, especially in finance, retail, or supply chain domains.

⚡ Fun fact: I started my journey in civil engineering but pivoted to data analytics to uncover insights that impact millions. I love storytelling with data just as much as building models.

✅ Project 1: Vendor Performance Analysis
🛒 Vendor Performance Analysis – Retail/Wholesale

Python | Power BI | SQL | EDA

This project analyzes vendor performance, inventory turnover, and profitability in the retail/wholesale industry. The goal is to help businesses optimize profitability, reduce risks from vendor dependency, and improve operational efficiency.

📑 Business Problem

Underperforming vendors dragging profitability

Over-reliance on top suppliers

High holding costs due to slow-moving inventory

Profitability variance across vendors

🔎 Key Insights

Top 10 vendors contribute 65.7% of purchases → dependency risk

Bulk purchasing yields 72% lower unit costs

Slow-moving inventory locks $2.71M of capital

Low-volume vendors have pricing inefficiencies despite higher margins

Statistical tests confirmed significant profitability differences

📊 Visual Insights

Correlation heatmaps (sales, profit, cost)

Profit margin distributions

Vendor-level performance comparison

Power BI Dashboard with interactive drill-downs

🚀 Recommendations

Diversify vendor base to reduce dependency

Optimize pricing for low-volume, high-margin vendors

Leverage bulk purchase discounts

Reduce unsold stock via clearance, forecasting

Boost marketing/distribution for weak vendors

✅ Project 2: Customer Churn Analysis
📉 Customer Churn Dashboard with ML

Python | Power BI | SQL | EDA | ML

This project predicts customer churn using machine learning and presents insights in an interactive Power BI dashboard.

📊 Key Findings

Churn Rate: 27% (needs urgent attention)

High-risk segments: Females, age 20–35, tenure <18 months

Contract Type: Month-to-month → highest churn (46.5%)

Payment Method: Mailed check users churn the most (37.8%)

Geography: J&K, Assam, Jharkhand have highest churn rates

Services: Lack of device protection/tech support correlates with higher churn

🔮 Prediction Model

Logistic Regression & Random Forest used

Identified 377 high-risk customers with attributes like monthly charge, tenure, payment type

💡 Recommendations

Convert customers to annual contracts with discounts

Target retention campaigns for females (20–35, 6–18 months tenure)

Move check/bank withdrawal users to digital auto-pay

Upsell device protection & security plans

Investigate low-charge, high-referral customers leaving → possible dissatisfaction

✅ Project 3: Bank Loan Analysis
🏦 Loan Application & Risk Analysis

SQL | Power BI

This project focuses on analyzing loan applications to uncover trends in borrower behavior and repayment patterns.

📈 High-Level Metrics

Total Loan Applications: 38.6K

Funded Amount: $435.8M

Amount Received: $473.1M

Avg Interest Rate: 12%

Avg DTI: 13.3%

🔎 Key Insights

Loan demand nearly doubled in one year

Debt consolidation = top reason (18K loans)

Long-term loans (60 months) preferred by 73% of applicants

Largest group: applicants with 10+ years of employment

Geographic concentration: Eastern & Central U.S.

💡 Business Impact

Focus product offerings on debt consolidation

Optimize pricing/risk models for 60-month loans

Develop strategies for renters & mortgage holders

Target acquisition campaigns in high-demand regions

✅ Project 4: Loan Default Prediction
⚠️ Loan Default Risk Modeling

Python | EDA | ML

Financial institutions face significant challenges in managing credit risk. This project predicts likelihood of borrower default using historical loan data.

🎯 Objectives

Identify high-risk borrowers

Enable better credit decision-making

Reduce financial losses from defaults

🛠 Workflow

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Model Development & Insights

📊 Key Insights

Borrowers with poor credit history → highest default risk

High loan-to-income ratio strongly linked to defaults

Default risk modeling helps prioritize loan approval strategies
