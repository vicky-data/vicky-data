# 👋 Hi, I’m Vigneshwaran (@vicky-data)

👀 I’m interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, BFSI Analytics, and solving real-world business problems with data.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced machine learning, time series forecasting, and Generative AI to enhance my portfolio.

💼 I’ve built projects in customer segmentation, loan default prediction, and time series forecasting — focused on delivering business insights.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on real-world analytics and ML projects, especially in finance, retail, or supply chain domains.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: I started my journey in civil engineering but pivoted to data science to build models that impact millions. I love storytelling with data just as much as building models.

# ✅ Project 1: Customer Segmentation

## 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project applies unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering) to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The analysis helps businesses tailor marketing strategies, target promotions, and improve customer retention.

### 📌 Problem Statement
Segment retail customers into distinct groups using demographic and behavioral features, enabling personalized marketing and data-driven decision-making.

### 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (KMeans, PCA)
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

### 📊 Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
4. Clustering using K-Means
5. Segment Profiling & Business Recommendations

### 📈 Results
- 3 distinct customer segments identified:
  - **Cluster 1**: High-income, few purchases, premium buyers
  - **Cluster 2**: Mid-income, frequent buyers
  - **Cluster 3**: Low-income, discount-driven families
- Recommendations provided for targeted marketing campaigns.

# ✅ Project 2: Loan Status Prediction

## 🏦 Loan Status Prediction (with GUI)

This end-to-end ML project predicts loan approval status using classification algorithms and includes a deployed GUI for user input and predictions.

### 📌 Problem Statement
Predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant profiles, income, credit history, and loan-related details.

### 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVC
- Tkinter (GUI), Matplotlib

### 📊 Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & EDA
2. Feature Engineering & Encoding
3. Model Training & Evaluation
4. Hyperparameter Tuning (RandomizedSearchCV)
5. Cross-Validation (K-Fold)
6. GUI Deployment using Tkinter

### ⚙️ Key Insights
- **Credit History** was the most influential factor.
- **Random Forest** achieved the best accuracy (~80%).
- GUI allows users to predict approval status using form inputs.

### 📎 Dataset

# ✅ Project 3: Air Passenger Forecasting

## ✈️ Air Passenger Forecasting using Auto ARIMA

This project uses time series forecasting (ARIMA) to predict monthly international air passenger volumes based on historical trends from 1949–1960.

### 📌 Problem Statement
Forecast future passenger demand to assist airlines and travel planners in capacity, logistics, and pricing strategies.

### 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas
- pmdarima (auto_arima)
- Matplotlib

### 📊 Workflow
1. Time Series Decomposition & Visualization
2. Stationarity Checks
3. Parameter Tuning with `auto_arima`
4. Model Training & Forecasting
5. Evaluation & Trend Analysis

### 📈 Key Insights
- Seasonality and trend captured accurately.
- Forecast for 1961: ~430K to 630K monthly passengers.
- Project highlights real-world use of forecasting in aviation and logistics.

### 📎 Dataset
